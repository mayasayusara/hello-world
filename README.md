In today’s global economy. I’m sure that many of you know a product that’s IFD. Imported From Detroit.
But today I’d like to introduce you to a new product Imported From Detroit… Me..
I was manufactured during the 1980’s in Detroit, MI. Also known as the Motor City and home to “The Big 3” GM, Ford, & Chrysler. 
I am one of 5 products manufactured by my parents. So, I guess you could as call me a limited edition.
As for my dimensions, I am 5’4” and I come with all of the standard features of a human female.
Like many IFD products we are often exported throughout the US and abroad. 
My favorite export location is here in the Coachella Valley. 

In conclusion, I hope that everyone learned a little bit more about this new product from Detroit. 
You will find me exploring the Coachella Valley. Please note that accessories are not sold separately and batteries are not included.
My name is Sharon Wright and it’s a pleasure to meet you.
